# Multiple-Input-and-Output-Channels
This notebook demonstrates how convolutional layers process multi-channel inputs—such as RGB images—by combining multiple filters into a single, meaningful feature map. It provides a step-by-step exploration of how convolution works when handling color images and illustrates the intermediate feature representations generated by each filter.
