# ðŸ§  Multiple Channel Convolution  
**Understanding multi-channel convolution operations in CNNs using PyTorch**

---

### ðŸ“˜ Overview
This notebook demonstrates how **convolutional layers process multi-channel inputs**â€”such as RGB imagesâ€”by combining multiple filters into a single, meaningful feature map.  
It provides a step-by-step exploration of how convolution works when handling color images and illustrates the intermediate feature representations generated by each filter.

---

### ðŸš€ Project Objectives
- Implement **2D convolutions** on multi-channel data using `torch.nn.Conv2d`.  
- Visualize **feature maps** produced by convolution kernels across different input channels.  
- Explain how **weighted sums** across RGB channels form deeper learned features.  
- Build an **intuitive understanding** of multi-channel filter interactions in CNNs.
